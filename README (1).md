## Key Insights for Presentation

For my presentation, I will be focusing on the following two trends below which will help FordGo bike system in getting more users.

> The majority of the bike riders are male. This means that there is an opportunity for FordGo bike system to increase revenue by placing more adverts on stations majorly viewed by men such as sports channel.
> Subscribers have the benefit of  bike sharing sharing because there is none attached to customers. Emphasis should be place on this informtion in order for individuals to enroll as subscribers rather than customers.
> Subbcribers have the benefit of having a shorter trip duration. This might be as a result of access to better routes for shortcuts.
